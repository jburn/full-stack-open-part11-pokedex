For this part of the course, I chose the example project, which is made with JavaScript. For linting purposes, there are a wide variety of options, of which some of the most popular are ESLint, JSHint and StandardJS. The choice of linter depends on the preferences of yourself and the people you are working with. Usually linting libraries are highly configurable, so the choice isn't really that meaningful. For testing, some of the best options would be Jest, Playwright and Cypress. The testing tools choice is highly dependant on the types of tests we want to implement, from end-to-end to function level testing. When it comes to building the project, we could choose tools like Webpack, esbuild or Vite. Especially Vite will work well with our project's React-frontend.
There are multiple alternatives for GitHub actions and Jenkins for setting up CI. Some cloud-based ones are BitBucket Pipelines from Atlassian and AWS CodePipeline from Amazon. There is also GitLab, which is a GitHub competitor created primarily as a CI platform.
We should choose between self-hosted and cloud-based environments depending on the needs of our project. If company proprietary information was being handled in the project, it would be the safest option to favor self-hosting to avoid cybersecurity concerns, but for this little course project, a cloud-based solution will work just fine.
